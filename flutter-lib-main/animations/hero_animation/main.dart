// Comments explaining the Hero widget:

/*
1. **What is a Hero Widget?**
   - The `Hero` widget is used to implement a smooth transition animation between two screens.
   - It connects widgets on different pages with the same `tag`, creating a visually seamless animation.

2. **How Hero Works:**
   - The widget with a `Hero` tag on the source page (e.g., `MyHomePage`) and the widget with the same `Hero` tag on the destination page (e.g., `Detail`) are linked.
   - During navigation, Flutter animates the transition between these two widgets.

3. **Key Properties of Hero:**
   - `tag`: A unique identifier that links the source and destination widgets. It must be the same for both.
   - `child`: The widget that will be animated during the transition.

4. **Why Use Hero?**
   - It makes transitions more engaging and visually appealing.
   - Ideal for shared elements like images, icons, or text between two pages.

5. **How Itâ€™s Used in the Code:**
   - In `MyHomePage`, a `Hero` widget wraps the `Image.asset` widget with the tag `'background'`.
   - When the user taps the image, it navigates to the `Detail` page where another `Hero` widget with the same tag is defined (not shown in this snippet but should exist in `Detail`).
   - The `Hero` animation creates a smooth transition for the image between the two pages.

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - Ensure that the tags are unique to avoid conflicts with other `Hero` widgets.
   - The transition respects the `child`'s size and appearance in both the source and destination widgets.
